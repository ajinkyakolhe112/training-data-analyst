    3. gcloud ...
    4. cbt
- ai platform update in training data analyst
- modifying qwiklabs for ai platform & nano... & installing package again. 
- bigquery update to standard in Lab 3 of dataflow. Change the instructions in qwikalbs as well. Will need to create the view again for the purposes of standar format. 
- change bigquery labs in legacy format from bigquery labs. 
- Machine Learning
    - Lab 1. Remove csv files. They are supposed to be created from that lab.. (may be copy them in previoud directory and read them in subsequent labs)
    - Lab 2. Reset the kernel instruction is not clear. Expand on that. 
    - Lab 3. Add further experiments on how to ml modelling in that.. 
    - Lab 6. Remove JupyterLab via datalab. Make it platform indendant
    - Lab 7. Python 2, problem in packages. For python 3, how to make it work? Check david's repository. For dataflow job, can run it externally and simply use python 3 in the ai platform notebook.. The query is not correct. it doesn't select the subset.
